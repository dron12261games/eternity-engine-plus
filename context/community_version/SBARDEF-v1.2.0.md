## JSON lump
The version has been updated to "1.2.0".

## Selecting status bars to render
Support unlimited number of `statusbar` definitions.

## HUD fonts
The Doom HUD font contains a total of 95 glyphs, which represent the ASCII characters from `!` to `_` .

`root`

| `stem` | string | A string representing the first few characters of each glyph’s name in the WAD dictionary.

## The `name` field in the `statusbar` and `sbarelem` elements

An optional string identifier for the element. This field is intended for use in editors or configuration menus to provide a human-readable reference to the element. The `name` field has no effect on runtime rendering behavior.

## Status bar elements alignment
Alignment flags were undocumented in SBARDEF 0.99.2 spec.

`alignment`
| Flag | Description
